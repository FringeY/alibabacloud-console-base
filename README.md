A lightweight approach to achieve micro frontends. It's dead simple!

## Development
1. Jest, eslint and their related packages are installed in the root directory.
2. Npm scripts like `npm test` and `npm run lint` can be found in root's package.json.
3. All packages should be transpiled by babel before publication.
4. A shell script `init-package.sh` can be used to initialize a package, run `npm run add-package`, it will setup a basic configuration for you.
